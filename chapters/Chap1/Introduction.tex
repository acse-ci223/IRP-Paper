The prediction of financial markets has undergone significant evolution in recent years, driven largely by advancements in machine learning techniques. This study explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as advanced predictive models for analyzing time-series data across various asset classes. The primary objective of this research is to enhance the accuracy of financial market predictions by employing CNN architectures capable of capturing the complex patterns inherent in financial data. This project involves a comprehensive approach, beginning with the collection and preprocessing of extensive time-series datasets, followed by the development and iterative refinement of CNN-based models that address the unique challenges posed by financial market forecasting.

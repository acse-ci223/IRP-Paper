The methodological approach of this study encompasses several stages. Initially, extensive time-series data will be collected and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for deep learning applications. The data will then be transformed into image formats, such as candlestick charts, to facilitate the training of CNN models. Following data preparation, various CNN architectures will be developed and iteratively refined to optimize their predictive performance. The models will be trained using historical market data to learn patterns and trends that may inform future market movements.

In the final stages of the project, the developed models will be tested within simulated environments to assess their accuracy and practical applicability in real-world scenarios. This evaluation will be conducted through rigorous backtesting and benchmarking against standard market indices, such as the S\&P 500, to measure their performance relative to traditional investment strategies.

The primary objective of this project is to advance the predictive capabilities of financial market models through the development and refinement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. By focusing on the analysis of asset co-movements within and across various markets, the project aims to uncover complex interdependencies that influence market behavior. This will enable more accurate predictions and effective risk management in volatile market conditions. Additionally, the project seeks to provide a deep understanding of the dynamics of asset interactions, which will assist investors and analysts in making more informed decisions regarding multi-asset investment strategies. Ultimately, the endeavor aims to contribute valuable insights and tools to the field of financial analytics, promoting a more nuanced understanding of global financial markets.

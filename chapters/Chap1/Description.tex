This three-month project aims to enhance financial market prediction models by developing advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Focused on understanding asset co-movements within and across various markets, the project will gather and analyze time-series data from multiple asset classes using refined CNNs. The project will begin with the collection and preprocessing of data, followed by the development and iterative refinement of the predictive models. In the final month, the models will be tested in simulated environments to assess their predictive accuracy and applicability in real-world scenarios. This initiative is expected to offer significant insights into market dynamics, supporting more informed decision-making in financial investments and contributing to the field of financial analytics.

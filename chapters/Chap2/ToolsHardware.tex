\subsection{Current Setup and Planned Upgrades}
The project currently operates on a CPU setup adequate for preliminary tasks but limited for scaling. Plans include an upgrade to High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources at Imperial College London, intended to accommodate increased computational demands and handle larger datasets. Alongside this upgrade, custom PyTorch scripts will be developed to effectively leverage multiple GPUs, enhancing training efficiency and model complexity management.

\subsection{Impact of Upgraded Computational Resources}
The transition to HPC and the utilization of GPUs are expected to significantly improve computational efficiency and reduce model training times. These enhancements are crucial for effectively processing the extensive datasets and supporting the advanced computational needs of complex neural network architectures, thereby enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the project.

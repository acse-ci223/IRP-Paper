\subsection{Data Acquisition and Transition}
The initial phase of the project utilizes publicly available financial data from Yahoo! Finance for preliminary model testing, providing foundational data handling and processing. As the project progresses, it will transition to the CRSP database, accessed through Imperial College London. This shift introduces enhanced depth and quality in financial metrics, supporting more detailed financial analyses and model accuracy.

\subsection{Benefits and Impact of CRSP Data}
Transitioning to CRSP data will broaden the historical perspective and enrich data granularity, which are crucial for analyzing asset co-movements and improving the robustness of financial models. Utilizing this high-quality dataset is expected to significantly enhance the predictive accuracy of the models by providing a deeper dataset for more effective training and detailed analysis.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Transformation}
A systematic data acquisition process is implemented using Python scripts to automate data downloads, ensuring consistency and efficiency in initial data handling. Following acquisition, data is transformed into candlestick chart images, which are particularly effective for CNN applications, allowing the model to capture and learn from visual price movement patterns. This transformation process is integral to preparing the data for effective analysis.

\subsection{Integration and Impact on Deep Learning Analysis}
The transformed data is then integrated with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, which are designed to interpret complex visual inputs from financial markets, thereby enhancing the modelâ€™s analytical capabilities. This preprocessing strategy ensures that the CNNs operate efficiently and provides a scalable solution for handling large datasets and complex analyses, significantly improving the overall efficacy of the deep learning process.

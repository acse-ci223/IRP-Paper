\subsection{Data Acquisition and Scope}
We will access the comprehensive CRSP database, which provides a wide range of financial metrics from major U.S. stock exchanges, governed by secure protocols to ensure data governance and confidentiality. The database offers detailed daily and monthly data spanning several decades, invaluable for analyzing long-term market trends and asset behaviors. This extensive coverage is crucial for exploring asset co-movements and market cycles under diverse economic conditions, forming a robust foundation for our analyses.

\subsection{Preprocessing, Integration, and Model Training}
Post-acquisition, the data undergoes rigorous preprocessing to remove inconsistencies and transform it into formats suited for deep learning applications, such as candlestick charts. The granularity of the CRSP data enhances the training phase of our CNN models, allowing for the identification of subtle patterns and correlations. This detailed approach is expected to significantly improve the predictive accuracy and depth of our analyses, enhancing financial decision-making capabilities.
